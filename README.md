# Sales Dashboard – Excel Based

This project showcases an interactive **Sales Dashboard** created using **Microsoft Excel** for the month of **May 2025**. The dashboard is built from scratch using raw sales data, transformed into an easy-to-analyze format using **pivot tables**, **charts**, and **slicers**.

The dataset includes **daily sales records (May 1 to May 31)** across different product categories. The dashboard provides insights such as:
- Total Revenue
- Category-wise Sales
- Daily Sales Trends
- Top-performing Products

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, organize, and analyze sales data using Excel’s built-in features. It can help business stakeholders track performance and make data-driven decisions.

Skills practiced in this project include:
- Advanced Excel (PivotTables, VLOOKUP, Conditional Formatting)
- Data Visualization (Bar, Line, and Pie Charts)
- Dashboard Design and Layout
- Slicers for Interactivity

📁 **File Included**:
- `SalesDashboard.xlsx`: The main Excel dashboard with full interactive features and May 2025 data.

This is one of my resume-ready portfolio projects, aimed to showcase my proficiency in data analytics using Excel.
